Hi, I'm Jay Palat

**I bring a mix of leadership, technical, communication and product skills to help teams in delivering solid solutions to complex problems.**

I am currently a Software Engineer for Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute at the Emerging Technology Center. I've worked for companies including IBM, UPMC Technology Development Center, Celerity Innovation, ModCloth and Rhiza Labs.

I've advised/consulted with startups like Cedexis, All Facilities Inc and All Facilities Energy. My team at Thinkering came in Second Place during the 2014 Steel City Code Fest and was invited to participate in the Health 2.0 Pittsburgh Winner Circle event. In 2016 I was an invited Judge for Steel City Code Fest.
